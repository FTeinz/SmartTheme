# SmartTheme
Tasker tasks that change apps night/day theme (aka: blackout theme) 

##How to 

Download this repo by clicking the download zip button, unzip it, extract the xml files to somewhere in your phone, import them to tasker (long click the task tab and select import) and then is up to you, I use the time profile to set the apps to night mode from 6pm to 7am, and from 7am to 6pm in day mode.

##Apps 

The following apps are themed: 

* VLC 
* Reddit News 
* Pocket 
* Xposed installer 
* FeedlyReader 

More coming soon
